A Python program that predicts where cars, cyclists and pedestrians
will move next, from recorded autonomous-driving data.

A Waymo car records the scene around it: where each road user has been
for the past second, the lane lines, the state of the traffic lights.
From that one second, this program predicts the next eight: six
possible paths per road user, each with a confidence. A car approaching
a junction may turn or continue straight, and a single prediction would
average the two.

## Results

minADE: the mean distance, in metres, between the recorded path and the
closest of the six predictions. Lower is better.

Validation: 44,097 scenes. Test: 44,920 scenes. Both graded by Waymo's
evaluation server. Control: constant speed and heading, scored by
Waymo's metric code on the validation scenes. Model: 12M parameters.
Training: a quarter of the training split, 122,352 scenes, 20 epochs,
two sessions on a free Kaggle GPU. Not comparable to the public
leaderboard.

## Method

1. Waymo's files are read with TensorFlow's record reader and reduced
   to numeric arrays, one file per scene. (`stage.py`,
   `womd/store.py`)
2. Before training, the endpoints of the training paths are clustered
   into 54 typical destinations per road-user type: straight and far,
   gentle left, hard right. These are the anchors. (`fit_anchors.py`)
3. A transformer encodes the scene and, for each anchor, adjusts that
   anchor's path to fit it. A second head scores how likely each anchor
   is. In the loss, each training example trains the path of the anchor
   closest to the recorded path, and trains the confidence toward that
   same anchor.
   (`womd/model.py`, `womd/loss.py`, `train.py`)
4. At prediction time the 54 are ranked by confidence, near-duplicates
   are dropped, and the six highest are kept. (`womd/pruning.py`,
   `submit.py`)
5. The whole path from a scene to its six kept paths exports as one
   ONNX graph, checked against PyTorch. (`export_onnx.py`)

The exact inputs the model reads are drawn, column by column, at the
bottom of `womd/layout.py`.
